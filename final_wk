% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***

% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%



\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}

\usepackage{textgreek}


% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.



% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.



% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex



% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%Using package amssymb
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/
%\usepackage{mathtools}



% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmicx}
\usepackage[ruled]{algorithm}
\usepackage{algpascal}
\usepackage{algc}
\usepackage{enumerate}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[noend]{algpseudocode}
\usepackage{tikz} %circle solution
%\usepackage{mathtools}



% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

%\usepackage{graphicx}
%\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption}



% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

%\boldmath
The structure of graph connectivity in mammalian brain is necessary to understand essential requirement of neuronal function and its relationship. Brain microvasculature is one of the representations of brain activity as well as graph connectivity. For this reason, analyzing neuronal connectivity with(??) coordinated activity of large numbers of neurons, tracing the vasculature plays important role to analyze how function of neural circuits can be constructed. For example, blood flow in brain contains clinical importance in neurological disease. Vectorize and visualize microvasculature in 3D space can de described as three steps: (1) data acquisition, (2) image segmentation, and (3) Vectorization. Knife Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM) is the instrument that developed by Brain Network Laboratory (BNL) in Texas A\&M, which helps physical sectioning in various planes, i.e, sagittal coronal. By using KESM, it is possible to acquire the anatomical structure of entire mouse brain. However, there is technical realities such as detector noise, signal scatter, refractive aberrations, and acquisition speed while sectioning can degrade the quality of image \cite{Kau}. Furthermore, since Nissl stained image which stains cell bodies and endoplasmic reticulum has various type of background intensities, segmenting blood vessel remains challenging problem; there is no single algorithmic way to segment the desired region appropriately. To solve this issue, we analyzed the problem in order to segment blood vessel: (1) Anisotropic diffusion filtering, (2) Median Filtering, (3) Otsu\rq s multiple threshold, and (4) Rescaling intensity. Then, we reconstructed 3D volumetric data and rendered centerlines based on the 3D volume which generated from image processing process. Finally, we rendered 3D vectorized volume including elimination of duplicated filament. Overall, the result of preprocessing step for 3D visualization of microvasculature with Nissl stained image is promising in terms of comprehending details of neural circuits and its relationship.

\section{\textbf{Introduction}}

\subsection{\textbf{Motivation}}

The human neuronal structure has been concealed for thousands of years, therefore, researching on human brain is fascinating for those who stride to fully comprehend its structure and functions from biology and neuroscience. Moreover, Brain microvasculature has been shown to play an important role in disorders and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer\rq s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Parkinson\rq s Disease. However, the neuronal structure and its relationship is complicated and still remains poorly understood. To be specific, the topology and morphology of the mammalian neuronal network tangle inside of the brain that leads to hardly figure out particular functional brain activity. In this sense, tracing the microvasculature is inevitable procedure to understand human brain.

\subsection{\textbf{Background}}

\subsubsection{\textbf{KESM}}
Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM) was developed in Brain Network Laboratory (BNL) which is a state-of-art microscopy that provides high resolution physical sectioning image. KESM is cable of 2D and/or 3D image reconstruction of mammalian neuronal architecture. The instrument has been designed to volume digitized at 200MHz a specimen at 250nm sampling resolution, and delivers an aligned 3D mesh of uniform voxels: Voxels are assigned digital signal amplitudes for each optical channel (wavelength) used in scanning the specimen \cite{McCormick}. Fig.1 shows the structure of KESM. \\

        \hfill 
        \begin{subfigure}{0.23\textwidth}
                \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Nissl_volume.jpg}
                \caption{Nissl volume}
                \label{fig:Nissl volume}
        \end{subfigure}
        
        \caption{\textbf{KESM Nissl Data}. Nissl-stained tissue data from KESM are
shown (rat somatosensory cortex) \cite{Chul}.}
\label{fig2}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{\textbf{Nissl stain method}}
Nissl stain method \cite{Glaser} can stain cell body and endoplasmic reticulum, whereas, India ink stain method is able to stain only blood vessel. In other words, Nissl stain method enables to detailed studies of neuronal microvasculature as well as peripheral cellular tissues which lead to analyze whole-brain cortical and subcortical distribution of neuronal cell bodies. In Fig.2, (a) is a cropped Nissl stained image which has 500 x 500 pixels. A white region refers to unstained region representing a blood vessel. (b) is stack of the 2D images that is able to shown as a cube shape. 

\subsection{\textbf{Goal of the project}}
This project aims to visualize mouse brain microvasculature in 3D image. We can describe our work as followings: (1) Segmentation Nissl stained image data set, (2)  rendering 3D image volume by segmented images, (3) rendering center-line in 3D image volume, and (4) generating 3D vectorized image volume. For preprocessing image, since single threshold algorithm (i.e., Otsu\rq s optimal threshold method) is inappropriate to segment blood vessel in Nissl stained image, we adopted Anisotropic diffusion filtering \cite{Weickert},  Median filtering \cite{Justusson},  and Otsu\rq s optimal threshold method \cite{Otsu} with multiple layers. Anisotropic diffusion filtering and median filtering is non-linear method, hence, applying these methods in sequential order will not affect final result in order for reducing background noise that gives arise to various types of intensities. On the other hand, Otsu\rq s multiple threshold method and rescaling intensity should be used after reducing background noise for extracting desired region. (e.g., blood vessel)

Using KESM, we have been able to obtain whole-brainscale data from the mouse. \cite{Yoonsuck} The imaging principle of KESM is shown (b) in Fig. 3. The objective and the knife is held in place, while the specimen affixed on the positioning stage moves, and gets scrapedagainst the diamond knife, generating a thin section flowing over the knife. Line-scan imaging is done near the very tip
of the knife where the distortion is minimal. Illumination is provided through the diamond knife (green beam indicates the light path). \cite{Yoonsuck} We use (a) in Fig. 2 for our project's raw data. We cropped the particular region of the Nissl stained image data set by using ImageMagick \cite{Still}. (500 $\times$ 500 pixels $\times$ 100 images)

\subsection{\textbf{Image segmentation (Noise deletion)}}

We attempted to segment blood vessel in cropped image by 500x500 pixel. The most challenging part in our research is analyzing characteristic of Nissl data image because each stained feature has peculiarized attribute and idiosyncrasy of the sectioned region such as data loss while sectioning image. Furthermore, segmenting whole-brain image is problematic since the ground truth of grayscale mouse brain image by Nissl stained method has not been fully learned by human operator which cannot be undone. Even though the image data set has numerous neuronal information, we are still struggling to define unprobed region in brain structure. Lastly, the data set has more than 12,000 sectioned images, therefore, finding reasonable images in the data set was a time-consuming task. In this research, we aimed to find appropriate images in the data set and applied image processing algorithm by many times of trial-and-error attempts through empirical observations.\\

Although Otsu\rq s optimal threshold method is capable of automatically perform clustering-based image thresholding \cite{Sezgin} or reduction of the gray level image to a binary image, single optimal threshold not eligible to segment desired region (e.g., blood vessels). To be specific, Fig. 4 (b) is close-up image which applied single level Otsu\rq s  threshold method that generated from Fig. 4 (a). Because raw Nissl stained image tends to have a noise acquired from data acquisition step (e.g., knife chatter and image blurred phenomenon due to speed of acquisition by KESM). Therefore, we exploited Anisotropic Diffusion filtering and Median image filtering method in order to make a breakthrough the deficiencies for segmenting desired region.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Anisotropic diffusion  filtering}}

Anisotropic diffusion filtering is a technique aiming at reducing image noise without removing significant parts of the image content, typically edges, lines or other details that are important for the interpretation of the image \cite{Pietro}. Following equations are definition of Anisotropic diffusion filtering.

$$
\frac{\partial I}{\partial t} = \mathrm{div} \left( c(x,y,t) \nabla I \right)= \nabla c \cdot \nabla I + c(x,y,t) \Delta I 
$$

where $\Delta$ denotes the Laplacian, $\nabla$ denotes the gradient, \emph{div} is the divergence operator and \emph{c} is the diffusion coefficient. \emph{c} controls the rate of diffusion and is usually chosen as a function of the image gradient so as to preserve edges in the image.\\

coefficient \emph{c} is described: 

$$
c\left(\|\nabla I\|\right) = e^{-\left(\|\nabla I\| / K\right)^2}
$$

where the constant \emph{K} controls the sensitivity to edges.\\

Anisotropic diffusion is an iterative process until a sufficient smoothing is obtained. This process computes each successive image data set in predecessive clustered set of image. Briefly speaking, Anisotropic diffusion can produce a cluster of parameterized images, however, resulting image by each iterative process can be combined between the predecessor\rq s clustered image and successive image which fully depend on localized content of the predecessive clustered image. The reason why we adopted Anisotropic diffusion is each image has various type of background noises, but each feature can be localized in particular region since the feature (i.e., cell body and blood vessel) has morphological shape of characteristic. SimpleITK provides Anisotropic diffusion filter class. The input and output image must be a scalar with numerical type. (e.g, float and double)\\ 

\subsubsection{\textbf{Median filtering}}

\begin{figure}[b]

        \hfill 
        \begin{subfigure}{0.23\textwidth}

        \end{subfigure}
        
        \caption{\textbf{Median filtering principle.} (a) Image with a noise in the center with pixel
value (150), surrounded by correct neighboring values. (b) The median filtering result. The noise pixel value 150 is replaced with 124, so that the distinctive
pixel value is smoothed to be similar to neighboring pixel values. Adapted from \cite{Justusson} \cite{Dongkun}}. 
\label{fig8}
\end{figure}

Median filtering is a nonlinear filtering that often uses for noise reduction in digital signal processing as well as digital image processing. Median filtering is effective not only excellent in noise reduction, but also preserving edges. However, it requires large cost of computing depends on size of filtering mask. Fig. 8 shows an example of Median filtering. Each neighboring pixel values replaces each entry with the median of neighboring entries.

\emph{Rx,g = N $\lfloor$ n / 2 $\rfloor$}\\
$$

where,

$$
\emph{Rx,g : median pixel value.}
$$

\subsection{\textbf{Image segmentation (Extract specific region)}}

Since the Nissl stained image is likely to have a various type of intensities because it stains cell body and endoplasmic reticulum. In this sense, excessive intensities in background hinder to segment desired region. For this reason, we adopted Otus’ multiple threshold method in SimpleITK \cite{Lowekamp}. Owing to the fact CurvurtureAnistropicDiffusion class in SimpleITK filtered out image with numerical pixel type, it needs to transform the linear scale levels of intensity. In this case, it should be rescaled gray scale intensity, maximum to 255 and minimum to 0, because we extracted highest level intensity among designated level of intensities.\\

\subsection{\textbf{Automatic elimination of duplicated capillaries}}

Seed points on the six surfaces of the 3D volume data reconstruction were generated. However, while tracing the vascular 3D volume, the same part of vessel might be traced multiple times if multiple seed points on different surfaces lead to the same vessel. As a result, duplicated tracing results with different  tracing directions can exist for a single vessel and the processing time increased. Tracing from all the seed points on every surfaces of the volume would reduce missed vessels, but the redundant seed points can cause the duplicated tracing issue at the same time \cite{Wenjie}. We made a algorithm for solving the problem of duplicated tracing result.  Algorithm 1 is the pseudocode of  elimination of duplicated capillaries. Fig.10 shows the results of the tracing vascular from two seed points. They found a same vascular approaching from the other direction’s seed points. This shows that number 1 and number 2 are duplicated, which is the same capillary.
First, we retrieve the seed point data and its list of branches. Second, check the seed point of \circled{1} in Fig 1 and the other’s end point of its capillary \circled{2} in Fig 10. If each x-y-z coordinate are in close boundary by calculating Manhattan distance, check the endpoint of \circled{1} and the other seed point of \circled{2}, applying the same distance measurement for each x-y-z coordinate. We can assume that if those which are in the same boundary are meet the segmentation criteria as well as vice versa, there are duplicated. For further understanding,  we set the value of the boundary as 4, which is heuristic founding by manual elimination. Third, eliminate one of duplicated capillaries and keep tracking next seed point whether they are in the boundary or not. Algorithm 1 is our pseudo code.\\
After applying algorithm, the result has been enhanced compared with not eliminated capillaries. Fig 11. (a) shows the not applying the automatic elimination algorithm and Fig 11. (b) indicates the result after applying the algorithm. We can see the difference between them. Also, the complexity, in this case the vtk size and its coordinates, has been enormously reduced.

\section{\textbf{Conclusion and Future work}}

Nissl Stained raw images have various type of noises. By using image processing techniques that we have learned in class, we successfully segmented the desired region with pixel size 500 X 500. We will segment those region with more bigger size and more images of Nissl stained image such as 2000 X 2000.
