% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***
% *** not appear when using other class files.                            ***
% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%



\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}

\usepackage{textgreek}


% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.



% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.



% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex



% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%Using package amssymb
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/
%\usepackage{mathtools}



% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmicx}
\usepackage[ruled]{algorithm}
\usepackage{algpascal}
\usepackage{algc}
\usepackage{enumerate}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[noend]{algpseudocode}
\usepackage{tikz} %circle solution



% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

%\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption}



% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***

The structure of graph connectivity in mammalian brain is necessary to understand essential requirement of function and its relationship. Brain microvasculature is one of the representation of brain activity as well as graph connectivity. For this reason, analyzing its connectivity with coordinated activity of large numbers of neurons, tracing the vasculature plays important role to analyze how function of neural circuits can be constructed. For example, blood flow in brain contains clinical importance in neurological disease. To vectorize and visualize microvasculature in 3D space, there are three undepining steps: (1) data acquisition, (2) image segmentation, and (3) Vectorization. Knife Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM) is the instrument that developed by Brain Network Laboratory (BNL) in Texas A\&M, which helps physical sectioning in various planes, i.e, sagittal coronal. By using KESM, it is possible to acquire the anatomical structure of entire mouse brain. However, there is technical realities such as detector noise, signal scatter, refractive aberrations, and acquisition speed while sectioning can degrade the quality of image. \cite{Kau} Furthermore, since Nissl stained image which stains cell bodies and endoplasmic reticulum has various type of background intensities, it is hard to segment desired region as we wish. To solve these issues, we analyzed the problem in order to segment blood vessel for rendering centerline of microvasculature and applied image processing techniques: (1) Anisotropic diffusion filtering, (2) Median Filtering, (3) Otsu's multiple threshold, and (4) Rescaling intensity. Then, we reconstructed 3D volumetric data and rendered centerlines based on the 3D volume which generated from image processing process. Finally, we rendered 3D vectorized volume including elimination of duplicated filament. Overall, preprocessing step for 3D visualization of microvasculature with Nissl stained image is promising in terms of comprehending details of neural circuits and its relationship.

\section{\textbf{Introduction}}

\subsection{\textbf{Motivation}}
To comprehend However, the neuronal structure and its relationship is complicated and still remains poorly understood. To be specific, the topology and morphology of the mammalian neuronal network tangles inside of the brain that leads to hardly figure out particular functional brain activity. Brain microvasculature has been shown to play an important role in disorders and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Parkinson’s Disease.In this sense,

\subsection{\textbf{Background}}

\subsubsection{\textbf{KESM}}
Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope was developed in Brain Networks Laboratory (BNL) at Texas A\&M\ University. It will allow the reconstruction of mammalian brain architecture. The instrument has been designed to volume digitize at 200MHz a specimen (e.g., a plastic-embedded tissue block) at 250nm sampling resolution. The instrument delivers an aligned three-dimensional mesh of uniform volume elements (voxels): Voxels are assigned digital signal amplitudes for each optical channel (wavelength) used in scanning the specimen. Physical sectioning is used to circufent photon-limited image capture (a speed requirement). No deconvolution of the imagery is necessary. The speed of the instrument is such that we anticipate an entire mouse brain ($\sim1cm^3$) can be scanned in one month (one-shift operation). \cite{McCormick} Fig.1 shows the structure of the instrument.\\ 

\begin{figure}

        \begin{subfigure}{0.23\textwidth}

                \caption{Nissl volume}
                \label{fig:Nissl volume}
        \end{subfigure}
        
        \caption{\textbf{KESM Nissl Data}. Nissl-stained tissue data from KESM are
shown (rat somatosensory cortex). \cite{Chul}}
\label{fig2}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{\textbf{KESM Nissl Data}}
Mouse brain stained in Nissl, which reveals the distribution of cell body, was acquired in 2010. \cite{Choe2010} The Nissl data set in
particular enables detailed studies of whole-brain cortical and
subcortical distribution of neuronal cell bodies.\cite{Chul} In Fig.2,(a) is a single image (500 $\times$ 500 pixels). (b) is a 300 $\mu$m cube. The dark donut-shaped objects are the cell bodies labeled by Nissl. White ovals are unstained regions representing blood vessels. The voxel resolution was 0.6 $\mu$m $\times$ 0.7 $\mu$m $\times$ 1.0 $\mu$m. \cite{Chul}


\subsection{\textbf{Goal of the project}}
Our goal of the project is to (1) segment Nissl stained image data set. (2) Render 3D image volume by segmented Nissl stained image data set. (3) Render center-line of 3D image volume. (4) Generate 3D visualization with center-line.


\section{\textbf{Methods}}


\subsection{\textbf{Data acquisition}}
Using KESM, we have been able to obtain whole-brainscale data from the mouse. \cite{Yoonsuck} The imaging principle of KESM is shown (b) in Fig. 3. The objective and the knife is held in place, while the specimen affixed on the positioning stage moves, and gets scrapedagainst the diamond knife, generating a thin section flowing over the knife. Line-scan imaging is done near the very tip
of the knife where the distortion is minimal. Illumination is provided through the diamond knife (green beam indicates the light path). \cite{Yoonsuck} We use (a) in Fig. 2 for our project's raw data. We cropped the particular region of the Nissl stained image data set. (500 $\times$ 500 pixels $\times$ 100 images)

\subsubsection{\textbf{Rendering Automatic elimination of duplicated capillaries}}

Before tracing the vascular by Flatbox, seed points on the six surfaces of the volume were generated. However, while tracing the vascular volume, the same part of vessel might be traced multiple times if multiple seed points on different surfaces lead to the same vessel. As a result, duplicated tracing results with different  tracing directions can exist for a single vessel and the processing time increase as a result. Tracing from all the seed points on every surfaces of the volume would reduce missed vessels, but the redundant seed points can cause the duplicated tracing issue at the same time. \cite{Wenjie} We made a algorithm for solving the problem of duplicated tracing result. Fig.10 shows the results of the tracing vascular from two seed points. They found a same vascular approaching from the other direction’s seed points. This shows that number 1 and number 2 are duplicated, which is the same capillary. 
First, we retrieve the seed point data and its list of branches. Second, check the seed point of \circled{1} in Fig 1 and the other’s end point of its capillary \circled{2} in Fig 10. If each x-y-z coordinate are in close boundary by calculating Manhattan distance, check the endpoint of \circled{1} and the other seed point of \circled{2}, applying the same distance measurement for each x-y-z coordinate. We can assume that if those which are in the same boundary are meet the segmentation criteria as well as vice versa, there are duplicated. For further understanding,  we set the value of the boundary as 4, which is heuristic founding by manual elimination. Third, eliminate one of duplicated capillaries and keep tracking next seed point whether they are in the boundary or not. Algorithm 1 is our pseudo code.\\
After applying algorithm, the result has been enhanced compared with not eliminated capillaries. Fig 11. (a) shows the not applying the automatic elimination algorithm and Fig 11. (b) indicates the result after applying the algorithm. We can see the difference between them. Also, the complexity, in this case the vtk size and its coordinates, has been enormously reduced.
